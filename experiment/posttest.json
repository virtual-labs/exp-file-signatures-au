      "question": "After identifying a file signature in a traffic dump, what is the next step in reconstructing the file?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Ignore the file and look for another signature",
        "b": "Export the raw data bytes associated with the signature",
        "c": "Rename the file with the correct extension",
        "d": "Run a virus scan on the file"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Ignoring the file defeats the purpose of reconstruction.",
        "b": "Correct. After identifying the file signature, you should export the raw data bytes. ",
        "c": "Renaming is not sufficient for reconstructing the file.",
        "d": "Running a virus scan is good practice but not the next step in reconstruction."

    {
      "question": "When fixing a corrupted image header, why is it important to use the correct file signature?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The correct signature ensures that the file opens with the right application",
        "b": "It adds extra layers of security to the file",
        "c": "It increases the file size",
        "d": "It makes the file easier to share online"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Using the correct file signature ensures that the operating system recognizes the file type and opens it with the appropriate application.",
        "b": "File signatures do not enhance security.",
        "c": "File signatures do not alter the file size.",
        "d": "File signatures are unrelated to sharing capabilities."

      "question": "In the context of file carving from an image file, what does the 'offset' refer to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The size of the embedded file",
        "b": "The location of the embedded file within the image",
        "c": "The file extension of the embedded file",
        "d": "The type of compression used on the embedded file"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Offset refers to the position within the file, not its size.",
        "b": "Correct. The offset is the position within the image file where the embedded file starts. ",
        "c": "Offset does not relate to the file extension.",
        "d": "Offset is not related to compression."
