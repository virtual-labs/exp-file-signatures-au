      "question": "After identifying a file signature in a traffic dump, what is the next step in reconstructing the file?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Ignore the file and look for another signature",
        "b": "Export the raw data bytes associated with the signature",
        "c": "Rename the file with the correct extension",
        "d": "Run a virus scan on the file"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Ignoring the file defeats the purpose of reconstruction.",
        "b": "Correct. After identifying the file signature, you should export the raw data bytes. ",
        "c": "Renaming is not sufficient for reconstructing the file.",
        "d": "Running a virus scan is good practice but not the next step in reconstruction."

    {
      "question": "When fixing a corrupted image header, why is it important to use the correct file signature?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The correct signature ensures that the file opens with the right application",
        "b": "It adds extra layers of security to the file",
        "c": "It increases the file size",
        "d": "It makes the file easier to share online"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Using the correct file signature ensures that the operating system recognizes the file type and opens it with the appropriate application.",
        "b": "File signatures do not enhance security.",
        "c": "File signatures do not alter the file size.",
        "d": "File signatures are unrelated to sharing capabilities."

      "question": "In the context of file carving from an image file, what does the 'offset' refer to?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The size of the embedded file",
        "b": "The location of the embedded file within the image",
        "c": "The file extension of the embedded file",
        "d": "The type of compression used on the embedded file"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Offset refers to the position within the file, not its size.",
        "b": "Correct. The offset is the position within the image file where the embedded file starts. ",
        "c": "Offset does not relate to the file extension.",
        "d": "Offset is not related to compression."

      "question": "Which part of a file typically contains the file signature?",

        "a": "Footer",
        "b": "Middle",
        "c": "Header",
        "d": "File name"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Footers may contain other information, but file signatures are generally at the beginning.",
        "b": "The middle of a file usually contains data, not identification info.",
        "c": "Correct. File signatures are typically located in the header section of a file.",
        "d": "File names can be misleading and are not reliable for type identification."

    {
      "question": "What makes file signatures a reliable method for identifying file types?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They are customizable and change with user preference",
        "b": "They are embedded in every file and follow standard patterns",
        "c": "They depend on file extensions",
        "d": "They are encrypted for security"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Signatures are not meant to be changed by users.",
        "b": "Correct. File signatures follow a standard format that helps reliably identify file types.",
        "c": "File extensions can be misleading and are not part of the signature.",
        "d": "Signatures are not encrypted; they are meant to be identifiable."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

      "question": "Which of the following is an example of a file signature for a PNG file?",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is the signature for JPEG files.",
        "b": "This is the signature for ZIP files.",
        "c": "Correct. This is the standard file signature for PNG files.",
        "d": "This is the signature for PDF files."
