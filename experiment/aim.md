<h3>Aim of the experiment</h3>
The aim of this experiment is to introduce file signatures and demonstrate their use in file carvingâ€”the process of extracting files from various sources, such as disk images, network traffic dumps, or corrupted storage mediums. This experiment teaches how to use file signatures to identify, recover, and reconstruct files.


##### Applications
Forensic Investigations: File carving helps recover lost or deleted files from storage devices. It is crucial in digital forensics, allowing investigators to extract data even from damaged files, aiding in cybercrime investigations.

Data Recovery: File signatures enable the recovery of corrupted files. This technique is essential in data recovery when files are partially lost or damaged.

Steganography: In steganography, file signatures help identify hidden files embedded within images or other media. This is useful for uncovering covert data transfer in digital media.

Network Security: File carving is used to extract files from traffic dumps, which is essential for detecting and investigating malicious behavior or unauthorized data transfers in network security.
