      "question": "What is the primary purpose of a file signature?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To provide a unique identifier for a file type",
        "b": "To encrypt the contents of a file",
        "c": "To increase the file size",
        "d": "To compress the file"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "File signatures are sequences of bytes that uniquely identify a file type.",
        "b": "File signatures do not encrypt files; they only identify file types.",
        "c": "File signatures do not alter the size of a file.",
        "d": "File signatures are unrelated to compression."

      "question": "Which of the following file types is commonly identified by its file signature?",
      "answers": {
        "a": ".txt",
        "b": ".jpg",
        "c": ".mp3",
        "d": ".exe"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Text files do not have a specific file signature.",
        "b": "JPG files are identified by their distinct file signature.",
        "c": "MP3 files have a different signature but are not the most common example.",
        "d": "Executable files also have a signature, but JPG is more commonly discussed in introductory contexts."

      "question": "In the context of file carving, what is the first step you should take when attempting to extract a file?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Open the file in a text editor",
        "b": "Identify the file signature",
        "c": "Compress the file",
        "d": "Run an antivirus scan"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Opening the file in a text editor is not the first step for carving.",
        "b": "Identifying the file signature is crucial to begin file carving.",
        "c": "Compression is not part of the initial carving process.",
        "d": "While important, an antivirus scan is not the first step in file carving."

      "question": "What is another common name for a file signature?",

        "a": "File footer",

        "c": "Magic number",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "The footer is at the end of a file, not the beginning.",
        "b": "The file extension is not the same as the signature.",
        "c": "Correct. File signatures are often referred to as magic numbers.",
        "d": "The file path indicates location, not file type."

      "question": "Where is the file signature usually found within a file?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "At the end of the file",
        "b": "In the middle of the file",
        "c": "At the beginning of the file",
        "d": "Randomly located in the file"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "File signatures are not stored at the end of the file.",
        "b": "They are not found in the middle of the file.",
        "c": "Correct. File signatures are located at the beginning of the file.",
        "d": "They follow a specific pattern, not random placement."

    {
      "question": "Why might file signatures be more reliable than file extensions when identifying file types?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "They are visible in the filename",
        "b": "They can be used to compress files",
        "c": "They are embedded in the file’s content",
        "d": "They are longer than extensions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "File signatures are not visible in filenames.",
        "b": "They are not used for compression.",
        "c": "Correct. File signatures are embedded in the file’s content and cannot be changed as easily as extensions.",
        "d": "Length does not determine reliability."
